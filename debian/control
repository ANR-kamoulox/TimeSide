Description: open and fast web audio components
 TimeSide is a set of python components enabling easy audio processing,
 transcoding, imaging and streaming. Its simple architecture and high-level
 API have been design to process serial pipelines.
 .
 It includes a powerful HTML5 interactive player which can be embedded in any
 web application to provide fancy waveforms, various analyzer results, synced
 time metadata display during playback (time-marking) and remote indexing.
 .
 The engine (server side) is fully written in Python, the player (client side)
 in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
